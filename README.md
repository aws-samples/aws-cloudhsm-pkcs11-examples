[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aws-samples/aws-cloudhsm-pkcs11-examples.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aws-samples/aws-cloudhsm-pkcs11-examples)

## Building the examples

### Depedencies

#### Linux

The examples are tested on an Amazon Linux 2 AMI. You will need to have the
following packages installed:

* GCC/C++ 7.3.1-5
* OpenSSL 1.0.2k
* CMake 2.8.12

You can install these packages on Amazon Linux 2 by running

```
sudo yum install -y cmake gcc gcc-c++ openssl-devel
```

#### Windows

The examples are tested on Windows Server 2019 AMI. You will need to have the
following installed:

* Visual Studio C++ CMake Tools for Windows - Available via the Visual Studio installer.
* Visual Studio Build Tools 2019 - Available via the Visual Studio installer.
* [CMake 3.x](https://cmake.org/download/)


### Building

#### Linux

Create a build directory and execute CMake. This will create a Makefile for the
project. Run make to build the examples. Specifying HSM_USER, HSM_PASSWORD, and
TRUSTED_WRAPPING_KEY_LABEL are optional for source build, but required for tests.

```
mkdir build/
cd build/
cmake .. -DHSM_USER=<user> -DHSM_PASSWORD=<password> -DTRUSTED_WRAPPING_KEY_LABEL=<trusted_key>
make
```

#### Windows

Create a build directory and execute CMake. This will create a Makefile for the
project. Run make to build the examples. Specifying HSM_USER, HSM_PASSWORD, and
TRUSTED_WRAPPING_KEY_LABEL are optional for source build, but required for tests.

```
mkdir build/
cd build/
cmake .. -DHSM_USER=<user> -DHSM_PASSWORD=<password> -DTRUSTED_WRAPPING_KEY_LABEL=<trusted_key> -DCLOUDHSM_PKCS11_VENDOR_DEFS_PATH=<path_to_pkcs11_header_file>
```
The CLOUDHSM_PKCS11_VENDOR_DEFS_PATH is an optional parameter containing the path to the directory which contains the 
custom header file cloudhsm_pkcs11_vendor_defs.h.
If the parameter is not specified, the pkcs11 header file installed along while installing the pkcs11 sdk will be used
as default. The default path on Linux and Windows platforms are as following.
Linux: /opt/cloudhsm/include/pkcs11.
Windows: C:\Program Files\Amazon\CloudHSM\include\pkcs11

Now you will be able to open and use `ALL_BUILD.vcxproj` to build, run, or edit
the samples.

### Running

Application binaries are in the `build/src/` directory. Applications will request
a PIN on the command line. The CloudHSM PKCS#11 library will be used by default.
In Linux, the binaries have no file type. In Windows, the binaries will end in `.exe`

#### Linux

```
# After running make
$ src/digest/digest

	--pin <user:password>
	[--library <path/to/pkcs11>]
```

#### Windows

```
# After building
> src/digest/digest.exe

	--pin <user:password>
	[--library <path/to/pkcs11>]
```

### Testing all samples:

#### Linux

To run and test all samples, run the command ```make test```

#### Windows

Open and build `RUN_TESTS.vcxproj`. The build will run and verify the binaries.
Note that not all samples are currently support on Windows through SDK 5.
Please see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudhsm/latest/userguide/pkcs11-apis.html
for the latest list of support PKCS#11 functions in SDK 5.
